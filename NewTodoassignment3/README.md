# To-do Application

In this application, we have created a to-do list, which can be used to add items, complete items, and delete items. The list is updated continuously.

User can create a new item, which will make the item as "ACTIVE". On clicking  the check box, the item is completed and moved to Completed List, and on clicking the red sign, the item is deleted and moved to Deleted List.
